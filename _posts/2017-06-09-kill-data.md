Functional programmers are incredibly lazy.

More precisely, we defer commitment as late as possible. In extreme examples
like Haskell, we defer the computation of every part of every expression until
the last possible moment.

Even in less extreme cases, however, we push effects (such as input/output)
to the edges of our program. With Monad Transformers Library (MTL) or FTL, we
defer committing to specific effect types until our application's main function.

This *commitment to non-commitment* tends to have several benefits:

 * It improves comprehension, because low-level portions of the code needn't be
   concerned with unnecessary and distracting details;
 * It improves reusability, since higher-level code has more control over
   decisions.
 * *Sometimes*, it even improves performance (algorithm fusion in the case of
   Haskell's non-strict evaluation model).

Sadly, there's something about even the most *functional* code that is
inherently *not* lazy. Instead, almost all functional code eagerly commits to
*more* than it needs to, obfuscating intent and decreasing reusability.

I'm referring to the tendency of functional code to use *hard-coded data
structures*.

## Devil in the Data

Let's take the following code example, which tries to find an employee's manager
or returns an error message:

{% highlight haskell %}
findManager :: List Employee -> Employee -> Either String Employee
findManager es e = maybe
  (Left "Could not find manager of " <> show e) Right
  (find (\m -> m.id == e.managerId) es)
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight scala %}
def findManager(es: List[Employee], e: Employee): Either[String, Employee] =
  es.find(_.id == e.managerId).fold(
    Left("Could not find manager of " + e))(
    Right(_))
{% endhighlight %}

Notice how the code *commits* to returning the result in a hard-coded `Either`
data structure.

This is *far* more specific than the code actually requires. All the function
*really needs* is the ability to construct error and success cases, without the
ability to know anything about the data structure or to deconstruct it.

The code is _prematurely committing_ to a concrete data structure, which removes
the choice from all higher-level code (you don't have the choice to return the
error in an `IO` or `Future` monad, for example), making the implementation both
unnecessarily complex and more difficult to reuse.

In an ideal world, the `findManager` function would be *polymorphic* in the type
of data structure it returned. Further, the function would not require the
ability to construct _and_ deconstruct error/success values, since it depends
only on construction.

In an ideal world, our code would commit to *no* data structures.

## Constructing Polymorphic Data

To purge the blight of concrete data structures from our functional programs,
our first step is going to be to separate the capability of *construction* from
the capability of *deconstruction*.

Using an MTL-like approach, we're going to describe the capability of
constructing an `Either`-like structure:

{% highlight haskell %}
class EitherLike e where
  left :: forall a b. a -> e a b
  right :: forall a b. b -> e a b
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight scala %}
trait EitherLike[E[_, _]] {
  def left[A, B](a: A): E[A, B]
  def right[A, B](b: B): E[A, B]
}
{% endhighlight %}

These classes promise the ability to construct an `Either`-like structure from a
left or a right value. However, the structure they are constructing could be anything&mdash;including a sum type with many more terms than just right and
left, or even a `Monad` with an error and success case.

With this type class, we can now make the original code polymorphic in the type
of data structure it returns:

{% highlight haskell %}
findManager :: forall e. EitherLike e => List Employee -> Employee -> e String Employee
findManager es e = maybe
  (left "Could not find manager of " <> show e) right
  (find (\m -> m.id == e.managerId) es)
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight scala %}
def findManager[E[_, _]: EitherLike](es: List[Employee], e: Employee): E[String, Employee] =
  es.find(_.id == e.managerId).fold(
    ("Could not find manager of " + e).left)(
    _.right[Employee])
{% endhighlight %}

This was an easy change to make, but what happens when we need not just the ability to *construct* a data structure, but also the ability to *deconstruct* it?

The solution to this problem is surprisingly elegant.

## Deconstructing Polymorphic Data

The capability of deconstruction can be expressed directly as a *catamorphism*
or *fold* from the representation of a data structure.

In the case of an `Either`-like data structure, we can represent this
catamorphism with the following type class:

{% highlight haskell %}
class DeconstructEither e where
  either :: forall a b z. (a -> z) -> (b -> z) -> e a b -> z
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight scala %}
trait DeconstructEither[E[_, _]] {
  def either[A, B, Z](left: a => Z, right: B => Z)(e: E[A, B]): Z
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's how we could use this type class to construct a `leftOrElse` combinator,
which extracts the left side of an either if it's there, or else uses a
specified default value:

{% highlight haskell %}
leftOrElse :: forall e a b. DeconstructEither e => a -> e a b -> a
leftOrElse a = either id (const a)
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight scala %}
def leftOrElse[E[_, _], A, B](a: A, e: E[A, B])(implicit E: DeconstructEither[E]): A =
  E.either[A, B, A](identity, Function.const(a))(e)
{% endhighlight %}

This code is completely polymorphic in the type of data structure it operates
on, requiring only the ability to deconstruct an either-like data structure into
its components.

However, it's hard to look at this code without noticing there's a lot of
boilerplate. The *catamorphism* of deconstruction is eerily similar to the
*anamorphism* of construction, yet we have two type classes, one for
construction, and one for deconstruction.

With a little bit of abstraction, we can completely eliminate all this
boilerplate and make generic abstractions for construction and deconstruction.

## Generic Constructors & Deconstructors

As a first step, we'll refactor the constructors and deconstructors for `Either`
as follows:

{% highlight haskell %}
type EitherConstructor e a b =
  { left  :: a -> e a b,
    right :: b -> e a b }

class EitherConstruct e where
  construct :: forall a b. EitherConstructor e a b

class EitherDeconstruct e1 where
  deconstruct :: forall e2 a b. e1 a b ->
    EitherConstructor e2 a b -> e2 a b
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight scala %}
trait EitherConstructor[E[_, _], A, B] {
  def left(a: A): E[A, B]
  def right(b: B): E[A, B]
}
trait EitherConstruct[E[_, _]] {
  def construct[A, B]: EitherConstructor[E, A, B]
}
trait EitherDeconstruct[E1[_, _]] {
  def deconstruct[E2[_, _], A, B](e1: E1[A, B])(m: EitherConstructor[E2, A, B]): E2[A, B]
}
{% endhighlight %}

These classes lets you simply build and match against either-like structures as
follows:

{% highlight haskell %}
type Const a b = a
deconstruct (construct.left "testing" :: Const String Int) {
  left : id,
  right : const "Wasn't there!"
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight scala %}
type Const[A, B] = A
D.deconstruct(C.construct[String, Int].left("testing"))(new  
  EitherConstructor[Const, String, Int] {
    def left(a: String): Const[String, Int] = a
    def right(b: Int): Const[String, Int] = "Wasn't there!"
})
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that we can abstract over *all* constructors of a given arity in
straightforward fashion:

{% highlight haskell %}
class Construct0 m0 repr where
  make0 :: m0 repr

class Construct1 m1 (repr :: * -> *) where
  make1 :: forall a. m1 repr a

class Construct2 m2 (repr :: * -> * -> *) where
  make2 :: forall a b. m2 repr a b

class Deconstruct0 m0 rep1 where
  switch0 :: forall rep2. rep1 -> m0 rep2 -> rep2

class Deconstruct1 m1 rep1 where
  switch1 :: forall rep2 a. rep1 a ->
    m1 rep2 a -> rep2 a

class Deconstruct2 m2 rep1 where
  switch2 :: forall rep2 a b. rep1 a b ->
    m1 rep2 a b -> rep2 a b
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight scala %}
trait Construct0[M0[_], Rep] {
  def make0: M0[Rep]
}
trait Construct1[M1[_[_], _], Rep[_]] {
  def make1[A]: M1[Rep, A]
}
trait Construct2[M2[_[_, _], _, _], Rep[_, _]] {
  def make2[A, B]: M2[Rep, A, B]
}
trait Deconstruct0[M0[_], Rep1] {
  def switch0[Rep2](rep1: Rep1)(m: M0[Rep2]): Rep2
}
trait Deconstruct1[M1[_[_], _], Rep1[_]] {
  def switch1[Rep2[_], A](rep1: Rep1[A])(m: M1[Rep2, A]): Rep2[A]
}
trait Deconstruct2[M2[_[_, _], _, _], Rep1[_, _]] {
  def swtich2[Rep2[_, _], A, B](rep1: Rep1[A, B])(m: M2[Rep2, A, B]): Rep2[A, B]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's a concrete example of instances of these classes for constructing and
deconstructing the `Either` data structure:

{% highlight haskell %}
data EitherConstructor e a b = EitherConstructor {
    left  :: a -> e a b,
    right :: b -> e a b }

instance eitherConstruct :: Construct2 EitherConstructor Either where
  make2 = EitherConstructor { left : Left, right : Right }

instance eitherDeconstruct :: Deconstruct2 EitherConstructor Either where
  switch2 (Left v) (EitherConstructor r) = r.left v
  switch2 (Right v) (EitherConstructor r) = r.right v
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight scala %}
trait EitherConstructor[E[_, _], A, B] {
  def left(a: A): E[A, B]

  def right(b: B): E[A, B]
}
implicit val eitherConstruct = new Construct2[EitherConstructor, Either] {
  def make2[A, B] = new EitherConstructor[Either, A, B] {
    def left(a: A): Either[A, B] = Left(a)

    def right(b: B): Either[A, B] = Right(b)
  }
}
implicit val eitherDeconstruct = new Deconstruct2[EitherConstructor, Either] {
  def switch2[Rep2[_, _], A, B](e: Either[A, B])(m: EitherConstructor[Rep2, A, B]): Either[A, B] =
    e match {
      case Left(v) => m.left(v)
      case Right(v) => m.right(v)
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we can refactor our toy example to use this machinery as follows:

{% highlight haskell %}
type Const a b = a
switch2 (make2.left "testing" :: Const String Int) {
  left : id,
  right : const "Wasn't there!"
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight scala %}
type Const[A, B] = A
C.switch2(D.make2[String, Int].left("testing"))(new  
  EitherConstructor[Const, String, Int] {
    def left(a: String): Const[String, Int] = a
    def right(b: Int): Const[String, Int] = "Wasn't there!"
})
{% endhighlight %}

There you have it&mdash;code that's fully polymorphic in construction and
deconstruction. It works with any data structure that can provide the
capabilities it needs, and *only* the capabilities it needs.

Now let's revisit our original example.

## Polymorphic Overload

Our original example that motivated this development was the `findManger` function:

{% highlight haskell %}
findManager :: List Employee -> Employee -> Either String Employee
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight scala %}
def findManager(es: List[Employee], e: Employee): Either[String, Employee]
{% endhighlight %}

If we modified this example to use a polymorphic return value, we'd end up
with the following type signature:

{% highlight haskell %}
findManager :: forall e. Construct2 EitherConstructor e =>
  List Employee -> Employee -> e String Employee
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight scala %}
def findManager[E[_, _]](es: List[Employee], e: Employee)(
  implicit C: Construct2[EitherConstructor, E]): E[String, Employee]
{% endhighlight %}

This function could be used to return any type of structure which is at least as
capable as `Either`'s constructors, including any `Monad` that had failure and
success cases, or other sum types that have more than two terms.

While more flexible, the function is still monomorphic in the type of `List`,
`Employee`, and `String`. If taken to its logical conclusion, then making this
function totally polymorphic would yield something like this:

{% highlight haskell %}
findManager :: forall e l p s.
  Construct2 EitherConstructor e =>
  Deconstruct1 ListConstructor l =>
  Deconstruct0 EmployeeConstructor p =>
  Construct0 StringConstructor s =>
  l p -> p -> e s p
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight scala %}
def findManager[E[_, _], L[_], P, S](es: L[P], e: P)(
  implicit E: Construct2[EitherConstructor, E],
  implicit L: Deconstruct1[ListConstructor, L],
  implicit P: Deconstruct0[EmployeeConstructor, P],
  implicit S: Construct0[StringConstructor, S]): E[S, P]
{% endhighlight %}

If we change a bunch of names and use Unicode and type alias operators, we can
make this horrible soup of letters and symbols a little more readable,
possibly close to the following:

{% highlight haskell %}
findManager :: forall e l p s.
  Either   ↑₂ e =>
  List     ↓₁ l =>
  Employee ↓₀ p =>
  String   ↑₀ s =>
  l p -> p -> e s p
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight scala %}
def findManager[E[_, _], L[_], P, S](es: L[P], e: P)(
  implicit E: Either   ↑₂ E,
  implicit L: List     ↓₁ L,
  implicit P: Employee ↓₀ P,
  implicit S: String   ↑₀ S): E[S, P]
{% endhighlight %}

That's about the best we can get&mdash;and let's be honest, it's not very good.
There's still a lot of boilerplate, and while all this polymorphism is very
powerful, must code won't need it.

It's a heavy price to pay for fringe use cases. *Too heavy*, I'd say, at least
with *today's* programming languages.

## Looking Forward

Ultimately, I'd argue that today's programming languages are unnaturally
obsessed with data. They are wedded to the idea of rigid layouts of bits in
memory&mdash;for understandably pragmatic or historic reasons.

Yet, the functions we develop in our code don't *usually* require bits. Instead,
they require *capabilities*. Some to construct, some to deconstruct. If we
expressed these capabilities precisely, we could free our code from having to
know too much about the structures it operates on, while at the same time making
our code much more reusable for different purposes.

We can model this degree of polymorphism with today's programming languages, but
it's awfully cumbersome. However, if we were building a *next-generation*
programming language, we could make it difficult or impossible to make our code
depend on "layouts of bits", and instead, make it trivial to require only as
much structure as we need to implement each function.

For now, though, I recommend you stick to data structures when you must, and
judiciously incorporate data polymorphism where it makes sense to do so, which
will be cases where the opportunities for reuse vastly outweigh the overhead.
